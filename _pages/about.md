Hello! My name is Alaia, and I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania. I am fortunate to be advised by [Rajeev Alur](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/). I am currently working on neurosymbolic learning with black-box program components. My research is supported by a gift from [AWS](https://asset.seas.upenn.edu/penn-engineering-ph-d-students-receive-funding-from-amazon-to-advance-trustworthy-ai/).

Previously, I did my B.S. and M.Eng. at Cornell University where I did research under [Nate Foster](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/) and [Alexandra Silva](https://alexandrasilva.org/) on automata learning.
