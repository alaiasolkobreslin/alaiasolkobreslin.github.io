Hello! My name is Alaia, and I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania. I am fortunate to be advised by [Mayur Naik](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mhnaik/) and [Rajeev Alur](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/). My research interests include programming languages, program synthesis, and neurosymbolic learning.

Previously, I did my B.S. and M.Eng. at Cornell University where I did research under [Nate Foster](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/) and [Alexandra Silva](https://alexandrasilva.org/) on automata learning.
