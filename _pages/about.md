Hello! My name is Alaia, and I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania. I am fortunate to be advised by [Rajeev Alur](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/). My current research interests include:

- Scalable neurosymbolic learning algorithms
- Neurosymbolic applications, including reducing hallucinations in LLM-generated code and ML predictions in clinical settings.


In the past, I have interned in the [Automated Reasoning Group](https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/automated-reasoning) at AWS where I worked on using formal methods to improve the trustworthiness of LLM-generated code. My research has previously been supported by a gift from [AWS](https://asset.seas.upenn.edu/penn-engineering-ph-d-students-receive-funding-from-amazon-to-advance-trustworthy-ai/).
