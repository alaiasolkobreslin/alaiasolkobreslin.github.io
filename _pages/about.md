Hello! My name is Alaia, and I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania. I am fortunate to be advised by [Rajeev Alur](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/). My current research focuses on 1) scalable neurosymbolic learning algorithms and 2) trustworthy machine learning for healthcare applications. My goal is to use scalable neurosymbolic learning algorithms to apply medical domain knowledge to the problems of predicting sepsis and cardiac arrest. My research has previously been supported by a gift from [AWS](https://asset.seas.upenn.edu/penn-engineering-ph-d-students-receive-funding-from-amazon-to-advance-trustworthy-ai/).
