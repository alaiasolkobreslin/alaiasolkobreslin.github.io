Hello! My name is Alaia, and I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania. I am fortunate to be advised by [Rajeev Alur](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/). My research interests include programming languages, program synthesis, and neurosymbolic learning.

Previously, I did my B.S. and M.Eng. at Cornell University where I did research under [Nate Foster](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/) and [Alexandra Silva](https://alexandrasilva.org/) on automata learning.

Outside of academic things, I like to run, cook, watch movies, and crochet. I am also passionate about animal rights and veganism 🌱.

In a past life, I was an avid [Tetris player](https://jstris.jezevec10.com/u/Alaia/stats).
