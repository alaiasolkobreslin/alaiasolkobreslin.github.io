I am a second-semester M.Eng. student at Cornell University studying computer science.
I have had the privilege of working under [Nate Foster](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/)
and [Alexandra Silva](https://alexandrasilva.org/#/main.html) on DFA inference.
I have also worked with Nate on [Petr4](https://github.com/verified-network-toolchain/petr4).
I am currently working with [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/)
on a synthesis engine for Rust programs.
